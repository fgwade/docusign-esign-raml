  - name: AccountBrands
    description: |-
      The AcccountBrands resource provides methods that allow you to create and delete the account brand associated with an account.

      Branding allows you to add the look and feel of your organization's
      brand to the sending, signing, and email process making it easier for users to identify envelopes coming from your organization.

      The DocuSign Account Custom Branding feature lets you set the colors, logo, and text for your account. You can create any number of brand profiles with different settings to reflect each of your corporate brands or different internal divisions or departments.

      When you create or change a branding profile, it applies to everyone using that profile and affects all envelopes sent with that profile.
  - name: AccountConsumerDisclosures
    description: The AccountConsumerDisclosures resource provides methods that allow you to retrieve the consumer disclosures associated with the account.
  - name: AccountCustomFields
    description: |-
      The CustomFields resource provides a method that enables you to retrieve the custom fields associated with an account.

      These fields can be used with your account's envelopes to record information about the envelopes. The fields can be searched to find matching envelopes and track information.

      The envelope custom fields are shown in the DocuSign member console's Envelope Settings section when a user creates an envelope. The envelope custom fields are not seen by envelope recipients.

      There are two types of envelope custom fields, text and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. The list custom field lets the sender select the value of the field from a pre-determined list.
  - name: EnvelopeBulkRecipients
    description: |-
      The EnvelopeBulkRecipients resource provide methods that allow you manage the bulk recipient file for an envelope.

      The bulk recipient CSV (Comma Separated Value) file contains the list of recipient names and email addresses that you can add to an envelope to send the same document to a large number of recipients.

      The required and optional information that can be included the file is described in the [ML: BulkEnvelope: updateRecipients] method
  - name: EnvelopeCustomFields
    description: |-
      The EnvelopeCustomFields resource provides methods that allow you manage custom fields in an envelope.

      Custom fields can be used in the envelopes for your account to record information about the envelope, help search for envelopes and track information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

      There are two types of envelope custom fields, text and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. With a list custom field, the sender selects the value of the field from a pre-made list.
  - name: EnvelopeDocumentFields
    description: |-
      The EnvelopeDocumentFields resource provides methods that allow you to manage custom fields on a document.

      You can create custom versions of standard fields that combine of field properties, such as font type or size, or a validation setting.

      Note: Some advanced features and options are supported only in certain DocuSign plans. Your account plan might not support some options discussed in this help topic. For more information about which options are available for your account, check your account plan or contact your Account Manager.
  - name: EnvelopeLocks
    description: |-
      The EnvelopeLocks resource provides methods that allow you to manage locks on an envelope.

      You can lock the envelope, and set the time until the lock expires, to prevent users or recipients from accessing and changing the envelope.

      Users must have envelope locking capability enabled to use these functions.

      The EnvelopeRecipients resource allows you manage the recipients of an
      envelope. There are seven recipient types. All types share
      a [core set of parameters](#core-recipient-parameters).
      Some recipient types have additional parameters.

      <br>

      | Recipient type | Description |
      | :--- | :--- |
      | [Agents](#agents-recipient) | An agent recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the agent in routing order. |
      | [Carbon Copies](#carbon-copies-recipient) | Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing order. Carbon copy recipients receive their copy of the envelope when the envelope reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the envelope is completed. |
      | [Certified Deliveries](#certified-deliveries-recipient) | Certified delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. However, they don't need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. |
      | [Editors](#editors-recipient) | Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the sender. They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor. |
      | [In-Person Signers](#in-person-signers-recipient) | An in-person recipient is a DocuSign user, acting as a Signing Host, who is in the same physical location as the signer. |
      | [Intermediaries](#intermediaries-recipient) | An intermediary is a recipient who can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order, unless subsequent agents, editors or intermediaries are added. |
      | [Signers](#signers-recipient) | A signer is a recipient who must sign, initial, date, or add data to form fields on the documents in the envelope. |

      <br>

      Not all recipients are are available to all account types.
      Review your account plan to determine
      which recipient types are available to you.
      All recipient types are available in the Demo environment.


      ## Core Recipient Parameters

      All recipients, regardless of type, have the same common parameters.
      The following table contains the descriptions
      for the core properties for all recipient types.

      <br>

      | Name | Required | Schema Type | Description |
      | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
      | email | Yes | Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | accessCode | No | String | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |
      | addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |
      | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true**, an error is generated on sending. |
      | embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |
      | customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the envelope status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100 characters. |
      | emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT**: If this is enabled for one recipient, it overrides the Envelope Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |
      | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the envelope to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true**, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. |
      | idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|
      | iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*: Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional. The elements are: street1, street2, city, state, zip, zipPlus4\. The maximum number of characters in each element are: street1/street2 = 150 characters, city = 50 characters, state = 2 characters, and zip/zipPlus4 = 20 characters.<br/><br/>displayLevelCode: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*dobInformationInput*: Used to set recipient date of birth information and consists of:<br/><br/>*dateOfBirth*: Specifies the recipient's date, month and year of birth.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn4InformationInput*: Used to set the last four digits of the recipient's SSN information and consists of:<br/><br/>*ssn4*: Specifies the last four digits of the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn9InformationInput*: Used to set the recipient's SSN information. Note that the ssn9 information can never be returned in the response. The ssn9 input consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>*ssn9*: Specifies the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay. |
      | inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration | No | Boolean | Optional element. If true and the envelope recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings for the recipient's account. |
      | note | No | String | A note that is unique to this recipient. This note is sent to the recipient via the signing email. The note displays in the signing UI near the upper left corner of the document on the signing screen.<br/>Maximum Length: 1000 characters. |
      | phoneAuthentication | No | RecipientPhoneAuthentication | Optional element. Contains the elements: <br/><br/> *recipMayProvideNumber*:Boolean. When set to **true** thenrecipient can use whatever phone number they choose to.<br/><br/> *senderProvidedNumbers*: ArrayOfString. A list of phone numbers the recipient can use. <br/><br/>*recordVoicePrint* - Reserved for DocuSign. <br/><br/>*validateRecipProvidedNumber* - Reserved for DocuSign. | |
      | recipientAttachment | No | Attachment | Reserved for DocuSign. |
      | recipientId | No | String | Unique for the recipient. It is used by the tab element to indicate which recipient is to sign the Document. |
      | requireIdLookup | No | Boolean | When set to **true**, the recipient is required to use the specified ID check method (including Phone and SMS authentication) to validate their identity. |
      | roleName | No* | String | Optional element. Specifies the role name associated with the recipient.<br/><br/>This is required when working with template recipients. |

      ```


      ## In-Person Signers Recipient

      An in-person recipient is a DocuSign user,
      acting as a Signing Host,
      who is in the same physical location as the signer.

      In addition to the [core parameters](#core-recipient-parameters),
      this type adds the following parameters.

      The following restrictions apply
      to using electronic notary when sending documents:

      * Authentication methods are allowed for the signer but not the notary.
      * The Sign On Paper, Document Markup, Field Markup and Change Signer options cannot be used for the documents.
      * Tabs may be assigned to the signer, but cannot be assigned to the notary.

      Refer to [eNotary Resources][enotary-resources]
      in the DocuSign Support Center for more information

      this type adds the following parameters.

      <br>

      | Name | Required | Schema Type | Description |
      | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
      | canEditRecipientEmails | No | Boolean | Optional element. When set to **true**, the Agents Recipient associated with this Recipient can change the Recipient's pre-populated Email address. This element is only active if enabled for the account. |
      | canEditRecipientNames | No | Boolean | Optional element. When set to **true**, the Agents Recipient associated with this recipient can change the recipient's pre-populated name (`UserName`). This element is only active if enabled for the account. |

      | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
      | autoNavigation | No | Boolean | Specifies whether auto navigation is set for the recipient.|
      | defaultRecipient | No | Boolean | When set to **true**, this is the default recipient for the envelope. This option is used with the CreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndForms method. |
      | signInEachLocation | No | Boolean | When set to **true** and the feature is enabled in the sender's account, the signing recipient is required to draw signatures and initials at each signature/initial tab (instead of adopting a signature/initial style or only drawing a signature/initial once). |
      | signatureInfo | No | String | Optional element only used with recipient types In Person Signers and Signers.<br/><br/>Allows the sender to pre-specify the signature name, signature initials, and signature font used in the signature stamp for the recipient. |

collect payments,\nyou need a payment gateway account,\nwhich is the destination for the payments.\nCreate a payment account\nwith a supported payment gateway,\nand then connect the payment gateway account\nto your DocuSign account.\nTo learn how to connect a payment gateway account\nto your DocuSign account\nsee [Managing Payment Gateways][paymentgateways]\nin the DocuSign Support Center.\nYou must connect and manage payment gateway accounts manually\nthrough the DocuSign Admin console\nand through your chosen payment gateway.\nThere is no public API\nfor connecting payment gateway accounts\nto DocuSign accounts\nor for managing payment gateway accounts.\n\nCurrently\n[Stripe][stripe], \n[Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/), and\n[Authorize.net](https://www.authorize.net/)\nare the supported payment gateways.\n\n### How Payments Work\n\nTo make a request for payment,\nuse a [`formulaTab`][formulatab]\nthat has a\n[`paymentDetails`][paymentdetails] object.\nThis object includes\na list of [`paymentLineItem`][paymentlineitem] objects.\nEach line item refers to a [`number`][numbertab] tab\nthat contains the value of the each item.\nThe purpose of the line items\nis to transmit them to the payment gateway\nas metadata, so that you can use the information\nin the payment processor.\n\n**Note**: If the fileExtension parameter is not added in an API call, only base64 converted pdf files will be accepted.\nAny attempt to send a non pdf file without using fileExtension results in an error.\n\nThis is an example request for two books.\nEach book is specified in the `number` tabs\nlabeled \"Hamlet\" and \"Tempest\".\nThe books are referenced as line items\nby their tab labels\nwithin the `paymentDetails` object\nof a `formula` tab.\nThe formula of the `formula` tab\nadd the values of the same two `number` tabs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"documents\": [\n    {\n      \"documentBase64\":

Payments\n\n* An envelope is not completed until all payments are completed.\n\n* If a DocuSign account Administrator\n  deletes a payment gateway account connection\n  DocuSign cancels all in-process envelopes\n  that reference the deleted payment gateway account.\n\n* If the sender voids an envelope,\n  all payment authorizations are canceled.\n\n* If a required recipient refuses to sign,\n  all authorized payments are canceled.\n\n* If a required recipient's payment fails authorization,\n  DocuSign attempts to recover\n  by sending the recipient\n  notification about the failed payment authorization.\n  The recipient has the opportunity\n  to correct the payment method information.\n\n* Each recipient's payment is authorized separately.\n  Accounts are charged and payment made\n  after all required tabs are completed,\n  and all payments in an envelope for all recipients are authorized.\n\n* Refunds are not supported.\n  Conduct refunds or payment changes\n  with the payment gateway separately from DocuSign.\n\n* At this time, DocuSign does not charge a per-transaction fee.\n\n\n[enveloperecipientslist]: /esign/restapi/Envelopes/EnvelopeRecipients/list/\n[formulatab]:

can be added to envelopes and templates\nby setting the `customTabId` property\nwhen creating an envelope or template recipient\nor when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.\nThe custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.\nFor example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.\n\nWhen the `customTabId` property is set,\nthe new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.\nRequired information that is not included in the custom tab,\nsuch as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.\nIf the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.\n\nAfter the tab is created,\nit is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting.\n\n## Anchoring Tabs\n\nThe tab anchoring option\nallows you to send documents for signature\nthat do not have a fixed layout or format.\nIn these documents you might not know\nthe absolute location of the tabs\nwhen you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text.\nAs an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,\nthe DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab\nby correlating anchor information to data within the document.\n\nWhen the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs\nwith anchor information,\nit searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.\nWhen found,\nit places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.\nTab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.\n\nWhen you apply tabs to the document,\nDocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.\n\nTo use an anchoring option:\n\n1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.\nFor best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the envelope.\nFor example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the \"Borrower's Signature\" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text \"BorrowerSignHere\" in white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to appear and use \"BorrowerSignHere\" as the anchor string.\n1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.\n1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed.\n\nSetting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.\nFor Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nFor all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.\nDocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.\n\n### Rules for working with anchor tags\n\nWhen anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.\n\n* You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.\n* You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.\n* The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.\n* X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.\n* If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.\n* The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.\n* The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.\n\n### Tips and Tricks\n\nThe following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:\n* In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.\n* Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.\n* Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.\n\n## Automatically Populating Tabs\n\nIf you want similar tab types\nto automatically populate with the same data,\nyou must follow these guidelines:\n\n* Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters\n  `\\\\*` in front of the label.\n  If you omit the `\\\\*` prefix,\n  only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.\n\n  When automatically populating tabs,\n  the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.\n  In the JSON example below,\n  the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`\n  will be auto-populated as specified (\"Doe\" and \"John\")\n  each place they appear throughout the envelope.\n\n  ```\n  \"tabs\": {\n    \"textTabs\": [\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentLastName\",\n      \"value\": \"Doe\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"tabLabel\": \"\\\\*StudentFirstName\",\n      \"value\": \"John\"\n    }]\n  }\n  ```\n\n* Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.\n\n  For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,\n  each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.\n  If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true**,\n  and the other has the `bold` property set to **false**,\n  only the first one will be populated.\n  In order to automatically populate both occurrences\n  of the `Name` Text tabs,\n  the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.\n"

  - name: BulkEnvelopes
    description: |-
      The BulkEnvelope resource provides methods that allow you to send the same document to a large number of recipients and get the status of the envelope.

      General steps to use Bulk Send:

      * Create the bulk recipient CSV (Comma Separated Value) file that contains the list of recipient names and email addresses.
      The required and optional information that can be included the file is described in the [ML: BulkEnvelope: updateRecipients] method.
      * Create draft envelope by calling the Envelopes: createEnvelope method and add a bulk recipient signer. The envelope can be created from a template that has a bulk recipient.
      A bulk recipient signer is a Signer recipient type where `isBulkRecipient` property is set to true. There can only be one bulk recipient signer per envelope.
      Templates and draft envelopes can be saved with a bulk recipient signer, but a bulk recipient file must be uploaded before an envelope with a bulk recipient signer can be sent.
      * Add the bulk recipient file to the envelope by calling the BulkEnvelope: updateRecipients method.
      * Send the draft envelope by setting the `status` property on the envelope to `sent` and call the Envelopes:update method.
      Transitioning an envelope with a bulk recipient signer from `created` to `sent` triggers the sending of an envelope for each recipient in the associated bulk recipient file. The original (draft) envelope is discarded. The response returned from sending the envelope includes the following properties:
         * bulkRecipientsBatchId: Contains the batch identifier used to query the status of the entire bulk send operation.
         * bulkRecipientTransactions: Contains an array with identifying information about each envelope sent. The information included in this response:
            * transactionId: The ID used to reference the queued envelope transaction.
            * name: The name of the recipient assigned to this envelope transaction.
            * email: The email address of the recipient assigned to this envelope transaction.

      Once you send an envelope with a bulk recipient file, DocuSign creates a separate envelope for each recipient in the bulk recipient file - eliminating the need to separately create and send an envelope for each signer. You can get the status of the bulk send by calling BulkEnvelopes: get or BulkEnvelopes: list methods.

      You can customize authentication (access code, ID check, phone authentication, or social network IDs), add notes and other custom information for each recipient in the list by adding the information to the file.

      Bulk Send Limitations:

      * Bulk send must be enabled for your account (`accountSettings enableBulkRecipient` is set to **true**) and for the user sending the envelopes (the `allowBulkRecipients` property in `userSettings`  is set to **true**.)
      * Bulk send can only be used with Signer recipient types and there can only be one bulk recipient in an envelope or template. An envelope or template can have other Signers and recipient types that are added to the envelope or template normally. When a bulk recipient file is added to an envelope, the single bulk recipient Signer is replaced with all recipients in the bulk recipient file. There can only be one bulk recipient file associated with an envelope when it is sent.
      * When an envelope with bulk recipients is sent, the envelopes are added to a bulk recipient queue and sent in a metered fashion. There is a limit of 2,000 envelopes in the bulk recipient queue and an error message is shown to the sender if this limit is reached. If you receive this error, you should wait and resend the envelope at a later time.

      If you frequently run into queue limits, you can contact your account manage to discuss modifying the queue limits for your account.

  - name: EnvelopeEmailSettings
    description: |-
      The EnvelopeEmailSettings provide methods that allow you to manage the email override settings for an envelope.

      Email override settings change the reply to email address, name, or the BCC for email archive information, for the envelope. Note that changing email settings will only affect email communications that occur after the addition was made.

      The BCC Email address feature is designed to provide a copy of all email communications for external archiving purposes. DocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature, including the BCC Email Override option, include additional signer authentication options. To send a copy of the envelope to a recipient who does not need to sign, use a Carbon Copies or Certified Deliveries Recipient Type.
  - name: Envelopes
    description: |-
      The Envelope resource provides methods that allow you to manipulate and monitor envelopes.

      Once you have authenticated the user you can use the Envelopes: createEnvelope method to create an envelope. You can call the EnvelopeDocuments: update or EnvelopeDocuments: updateList method to add additional documents.

      Setting the `status` property on the envelope to `sent` allows you to send it or `created` to save it as a draft.

      You can receive envelope event notifications by setting the `eventNotification` properties. When the envelope or recipient status changes to one of the specified status codes, a notification is sent to a URL that you specify.

      If you have an envelope that you have previously saved, you can modify the subject and message, send it, void it, or place it in the purge queue using the Envelope: update method.

      In addition to receiving notifications you can monitor the status of the envelopes using the following methods:
      * Envelope: getEnvelope - To get the status of a envelope.
      * Envelope: listStatus - To get the envelope status for a set of envelopes.
      * Envelope: listStatusChanges - To get status changes information for one or more envelopes.

      If you need to delete a page from a document in an envelope, use the Envelope: deleteDocumentPage method.

      The resource also includes a number of methods that allow you to retrieve and set the initials and signature for certain types of recipients on the document.
  - name: EnvelopeTemplates

  - name: Groups
    description: |-
      The Groups resource provides methods that allow you to manage groups for the account.

      Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. A group can be associated with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but this makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. Groups can also be used with template sharing to limit user access to templates.
  - name: GroupUsers
    description: The GroupUsers resource provides methods that allow you to manage the users in a group.
  - name: SigningGroups
    description: |-
      The SigningGroups resource provides methods that allow you manage signing groups.

      Signing Groups allow you to create a group of people to which an envelope is sent. Any member of that group can open an envelope and sign the documents in the envelope with their own signature, even though a signature field was not directly assigned to them. When the Signing Group option is used, group members that open and sign the envelope are tracked in the envelope history and certificate.

      When one group member opens the envelope, it is temporarily locked and if other members try to open the envelope they will see a message saying the envelope is currently opened. If the group member exits the envelope without finishing the lock expires, allowing other group members to open and complete the envelope.

      When the envelope is complete, all members of the group will receive a completed notification and can access the completed envelope.
      The envelope history and Certificate of Completion will show that the envelope was sent to a signing group and record which members viewed and signed the envelope.

      An account can have a maximum of 50 signing groups. Each signing group can have a maximum of 50 group members.

      The Signing Groups feature is only supported in certain DocuSign Enterprise and System Automated Premium plans. Your account might not support this option. To access this functionality, contact your Account Manager or DocuSign Support (support@docusign.com) for assistance.
  - name: SigningGroupUsers
    description: The SigningGroupUsers resource provides methods that allow you to manage users in Signing Groups.
  - name: TemplateRecipients
    description: |-
      The TemplateRecipients resource allows you manage the recipients of an template.

      The exact parameters associated with a recipient depend on the recipient type. There are seven recipient types: Agents, Carbon Copies, Certified Deliveries, Editors, In Person Signers, Intermediaries, and Signers.

      Not all recipients are are available to all account types, review you account plan to determine which recipient types are available to you. If you are working in the Demo environment, all recipient types are available.

      Each recipient type is described below:

      [Agents](#agents): This recipient can add name and email information for recipients that appear after the recipient in routing order.

      [Carbon Copies](#carboncopies): Use this action if the recipient should get a copy of the template, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be placed in any order in the recipient list. The recipient receives a copy of the template when the template reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the template is completed.

      [Certified Deliveries](#certifiedDeliveries): Use this action if the recipient must receive the completed documents for the template to be completed, but the recipient does not need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents.

      [Editors](#editors): This recipient has the same management and access rights for the template as the sender and can make changes to the template as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor.

      [In Person Signers](#inPerson): Use this action if the signer is in the same physical location as a DocuSign user who will act as a Signing Host for the transaction. The recipient added is the Signing Host and new separate Signer Name field appears after Sign in person is selected.

      [Intermediaries](#intermediaries): This recipient can, but is not required to, add name and email information for recipients at the same or subsequent level in the routing order (until subsequent Agents, Editors or Intermediaries recipient types are added).

      [Signers](#signers): Use this action if your recipient must sign, initial, date or add data to form fields on the documents in the template.

      ### Core Recipient Parameters

      The following table contains the descriptions for the core properties for a recipient.

      | Name | Required? | Schema Type | Description |
      | --- | --- | --- | --- |
      | email | Yes | Email | Email of the recipient. Notification will be sent to this email id.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | name | Yes | String | Full legal name of the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters. |
      | accessCode | No | String | This optional element specifies the access code a recipient has to enter to validate the identity.<br/>Maximum Length: 50 characters. |
      | addAccessCodeToEmail | No | Boolean | This optional attribute indicates that the access code is added to the email sent to the recipient; this nullifies the Security measure of Access Code on the recipient. |
      | clientUserId | No | String | This specifies whether the recipient is embedded or remote.<br/><br/>If the `clientUserId` property is not null then the recipient is embedded. Note that if the `ClientUserId` property is set and either `SignerMustHaveAccount` or `SignerMustLoginToSign` property of the account settings is set to  **true**, an error is generated on sending. |
      | embeddedRecipientStartURL | No | String | This is a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would, but when the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to this URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, it is up to the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) to then request a recipient token to launch a signing session.<br/><br/>If the value `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN` is used for this node, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that would be launched by any partner.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application and DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets  the `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL` property to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) be used to verify the identity of the recipient.<br/><br>If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property is set, DocuSign ignores the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` property using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: templateId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The customFields must be part of the recipient or template. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/>`http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]` |
      | customFields | No | customField |An optional array of strings that allows the sender to provide custom data about the recipient. This information is returned in the template status but otherwise not used by DocuSign. String `customField` properties have a maximum length of 100 characters. |
      | emailNotification | No | emailNotification | An optional complex type that has information for setting the language for the recipient's email information. It is composed of three elements:<br/><br/>*emailBody*: a string with the email message sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 10000 characters.<br/><br/>*emailSubject*: a string with the subject of the email sent to the recipient.<br/>Maximum Length: 100 characters.<br/><br/>*supportedLanguage*: The simple type enumeration of the language used. The supported languages, with the language value shown in parenthesis, are: Arabic (ar), Bahasa Indonesia (id), Bahasa Melayu (ms) Bulgarian (bg), Czech (cs), Chinese Simplified (zh_CN), Chinese Traditional (zh_TW), Croatian (hr), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English US (en), English UK (en_GB), Estonian (et), Farsi (fa), Finnish (fi), French (fr), French Canada (fr_CA), German (de), Greek (el), Hebrew (he), Hindi (hi), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Norwegian (no), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR), Romanian (ro),Russian (ru), Serbian (sr), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es),Spanish Latin America (es_MX), Swedish (sv), Thai (th), Turkish (tr), Ukrainian (uk) and Vietnamese (vi).<br/><br/>**IMPORTANT**: If this is enabled for one recipient, it overrides the Template Subject and `EmailBlurb` property settings. Also, you must set the  `emailNotification` property for all recipients. |
      | excludedDocuments | No | Array of Strings | Specifies the documents that are not visible to this recipient. Document Visibility must be enabled for the account and the enforceSignerVisibility property must be set to true for the template to use this.<br/><br/>When the enforceSignerVisibility property is set to **true**, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an template, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an template is sent. |
      | idCheckConfigurationName | No | String |Specifies authentication check by name. The names used here must be the same as the authentication type names used by the account (these name can also be found in the web console sending interface in the Identify list for a recipient). This overrides any default authentication setting.<br/><br/>_Example_:<br/> Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as 'ID Check $' and 'SMS Auth $'. To use ID check in an template, the `idCheckConfigurationName` property must be  set to `ID Check $`. To use SMS, it must be set to `SMS Auth $` and you must add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.|
      | iDCheckInformationInput | No | IdCheckInformationInput | This complex element contains input information related to a recipient ID check. It can include the following information.<br/><br/>*addressInformationInput*: Used to set recipient address information and consists of:<br/><br/>*addressInformation*: consists of six elements, with street2 and zipPlus4 being optional. The elements are: street1, street2, city, state, zip, zipPlus4\. The maximum number of characters in each element are: street1/street2 = 150 characters, city = 50 characters, state = 2 characters, and zip/zipPlus4 = 20 characters.<br/><br/>displayLevelCode: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*dobInformationInput*: Used to set recipient date of birth information and consists of:<br/><br/>*dateOfBirth*: Specifies the recipient's date, month and year of birth.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn4InformationInput*: Used to set the last four digits of the recipient's SSN information and consists of:<br/><br/>*ssn4*: Specifies the last four digits of the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay.<br/><br/>*receiveInResponse*: A Boolean element that specifies if the information needs to be returned in the response.<br/><br/>*ssn9InformationInput*: Used to set the recipient's SSN information. Note that the ssn9 information can never be returned in the response. The ssn9 input consists of:<br/><br/><br/><br/>*ssn9*: Specifies the recipient's SSN.<br/><br/>*displayLevelCode*: Specifies the display level for the recipient. Values are: ReadOnly, Editable, or DoNotDisplay. |
      | inheritEmailNotificationConfiguration | No | Boolean | Optional element. If true and the template recipient creates a DocuSign account after signing, the Manage Account Email Notification settings are used as the default settings for the recipient's account. |
      | note | No | String | A note that is unique to this recipient. This note is sent to the recipient via the signing email. The note displays in the signing UI near the upper left corner of the document on the signing screen.<br/>Maximum Length: 1000 characters. |
      | phoneAuthentication | No | RecipientPhoneAuthentication | Optional element. Contains the elements: <br/><br/> *recipMayProvideNumber*:Boolean. When set to **true** thenrecipient can use whatever phone number they choose to.<br/><br/> *senderProvidedNumbers*: ArrayOfString. A list of phone numbers the recipient can use. <br/><br/>*recordVoicePrint* - Reserved <br/><br/>*validateRecipProvidedNumber* - Reserved| |
      | recipientAttachment | No | Attachment | Reserved |
      | recipientId | No | String | Unique for the recipient. It is used by the tab element to indicate which recipient is to sign the Document. |
      | requireIdLookup | No | Boolean | When set to **true**, the recipient is required to use the specified ID check method (including Phone and SMS authentication) to validate their identity. |
      | roleName | No* | String | Optional element. Specifies the role name associated with the recipient.<br/><br/>This is required when working with template recipients. |

      ## Tab Types

      This table lists the available tab types.

      <br>


      | Tab Type              | Description |
      | :-------              | :---------- |
      | Approve Tab           | Place this tab on the document if you want the recipient to approve documents in an envelope without placing a signature or initials on the document. If the recipient clicks the Approve tab during the signing process, the recipient is considered to have signed the document. No information is shown on the document for the approval, but it is recorded as a signature in the envelope history. |
      | Checkbox Tab          | Place this tab on the document in a location where the recipient can select a yes/no (on/off) type option. |
      | Company Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's company name to appear. |
      | Date Signed Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the date the recipient signed the document to appear. |
      | Date Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient to enter a date. Date tabs are single-line fields that allow date information to be entered in any format. The tooltip for this tab recommends entering the date as MM/DD/YYYY, but this is not enforced. The format entered by the signer is retained. If you need a particular date format enforced, DocuSign recommends using a Text tab with a Validation Pattern and Validation Message to enforce the format. |
      | Decline Tab           | Place this tab on the document where you want to give the recipient the option of declining an envelope. If the recipient clicks the Decline tab during the signing process, the envelope is voided. |
      | Email Address Tab     | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's email, as entered in the recipient information, to appear. |
      | Email Tab             | This is a single-line field that accepts any characters. |
      | Envelope ID Tab       | Place this tab on the document where you want the envelope ID for to appear. Recipients cannot enter or change the information in this tab. It is for informational purposes only. |
      | First Name Tab        | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's first name to appear. This tab takes the recipient's name, as entered in the recipient information, splits it into sections based on spaces and uses the first section as the first name. |
      | Formula Tab           | This tab is used to add a calculated field to a document. Envelope recipients cannot directly enter information into the tab. The formula tab calculates and displays a new value when changes are made to the reference tab values. The reference tab information and calculation operations are entered in the "formula" element. See the Using the Calculated Fields Feature quick start guide or DocuSign Service User Guide for more information about formulas.  |
      | Full Name Tab         | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's full name to appear. |
      | Initial Here Tab      | Place this tab where the recipient must initial the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |
      | Last Name Tab         | Place this tab on a document where you want the recipient's last name to appear. This tab takes the recipient's name, as entered in the recipient information, splits it into sections based on spaces and uses the last section as the last name. |
      | List Tab              | This tab has a list of options that a recipient can select. The `listItems` parameter is used to set the options that can be selected.  |
      | Note Tab              | Place this tab on the document where you want to add a note for the recipient on a document. |
      | Number Tab            | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter numbers and decimal (.) points.  |
      | Radio Group Tab       | This group tab is used to place radio buttons on a document. The `radios` parameter is used to add and place the radio buttons associated with the group. Only one radio button can be selected in a group.  |
      | Sign Here Tab         | Place this tab where the recipient must sign the document. This tab can be set to be optional.  |
      | Signer Attachment Tab | The signer attachment is where the recipient initiates the process of adding supporting documents to an envelope. |
      | SSN Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. A Social Security Number can be typed with or without dashes. |
      | Text Tab              | This tab is a field where the recipient can enter any type of characters.  |
      | Title Tab             | Place this tab on the document where you want the recipient's title to appear. |
      | Zip Tab               | This tab is a single-line field where the recipient can enter numbers. |


      ## Using Custom Tabs in Envelopes and Templates

      Custom Tabs can be added to envelopes and templates
      by setting the `customTabId` property
      when creating an envelope or template recipient
      or when adding a new tab for an existing recipient.
      The custom tab must be added as the correct tab type.
      For example if the custom tab type is text, it cannot be used as a number tab.

      When the `customTabId` property is set,
      the new tab inherits all the custom tab properties.
      Required information that is not included in the custom tab,
      such as document ID and page ID, must be included when adding the tab.
      If the custom tab does not have anchor settings, the X and Y positions must be included.

      After the tab is created,
      it is treated as any other tab for updating or deleting.

      ## Anchoring Tabs

      The tab anchoring option
      allows you to send documents for signature
      that do not have a fixed layout or format.
      In these documents you might not know
      the absolute location of the tabs
      when you design your API client application because the tabs must move with text.
      As an alternative to sending X and Y coordinates for tabs,
      the DocuSign Service can derive an anchor location for the tab
      by correlating anchor information to data within the document.

      When the DocuSign Service receives a request that contains tabs
      with anchor information,
      it searches the document for instances of the `anchorString` property.
      When found,
      it places a tab of the specified type for the designated recipient.
      Tab positions are established by setting offsets for the tab.

      When you apply tabs to the document,
      DocuSign does not remove or replace the text in the `anchorString` property. You can hide codified anchors by using the same font color as the background of the document. So the anchor can be used by DocuSign processes and it will not be visible on the document.

      To use an anchoring option:

      1. Identify the location in the document by text string. You can use a pre-existing text string or add a new one.
      For best performance DocuSign recommends using single word anchor strings when possible, especially when there are a large number of pages in the envelope.
      For example, you might want to add a Sign Here tab to the "Borrower's Signature" lines in a document, but that phrase might occur in places in the document where you don't want to tab to appear. In this case, you could add the text "BorrowerSignHere" in white font color (so that isn't visible in the document) to all the places you want Sign Here tabs to appear and use "BorrowerSignHere" as the anchor string.
      1. Reference the anchor through the `anchorString` property of the tab.
      1. Determine the offset from the anchor string location to where the tab should be placed.

      Setting a positive value in the `anchorXOffset` property moves the tab right on the page and positive values in the  `anchorYoffset` prove moves the tab down the page. The `anchorUnits` property specifies the units used for the offsets.
      For Sign Here and Initial Here tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the bottom-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.
      For all other tabs the bottom-left of the anchor string is equivalent to position (0,0), and the top-left of the tab graphic is placed relative to that.
      DocuSign does not currently provide tools to derive the offset values. Determination of the proper offset will likely require some trial-and-error.

      ### Rules for working with anchor tags

      When anchor tabs are used, all documents in the envelope are searched for the `anchorString` property.

      * You set the text of the anchor string in the `anchorString` property. DocuSign tabs are created for each instance of the `anchorString` property within the document, so special care must be taken to establish unique anchor strings that do not result in unintentional tabs.
      * You cannot use the same anchored tab for different recipients for the same document.
      * The DocuSign system cannot search for text that is embedded in an image when checking for anchor strings.
      * X or Y offsets supplied for a tab apply to all instances of the tab in the document. To use different offsets at different locations in the document for the same recipient, create multiple, unique anchor tabs.
      * If the Y offset value of an anchor string would force a tab outside of the page boundaries, the tag is placed at the page boundary. If the X offset value places a tab outside of the page boundaries, the error message `Invalid_User_Offset` is sent. The error message includes the X offset that resulted in the error.
      * The system does not support an anchor string embedded in the form of a PDF X-object in the document.
      * The system does not re-flow the text that surrounds the anchor tabs. It is the responsibility of the document author to provide sufficient white space to contain the potential width of the ultimate tab value.

      ### Tips and Tricks

      The following are tips for effective use of anchor tags:
      * In order to avoid unintentional conflicts between text contained in an `anchorString` property and the text that naturally exists in documents, establish a codified syntax for the anchor string text that is unlikely to appear elsewhere in a document.
      * Develop an extensible and consistent syntax that can be used across multiple document types.
      * Especially for documents that have variable numbers of tabs or signers, author the source document to include hidden anchor tabs for all potential signers/permutations. Then, control the tabs that are actually placed by including/excluding the anchor tabs in the request. This approach allows a single document to be used for all use cases instead of maintaining separate documents for each scenario.

      ## Automatically Populating Tabs

      If you want similar tab types
      to automatically populate with the same data,
      you must follow these guidelines:

      * Each `tabLabel` entry must have the characters
        `\\*` in front of the label.
        If you omit the `\\*` prefix,
        only the first occurrence of the tab is populated.

        When automatically populating tabs,
        the `tabLabel` must not contain any spaces.
        In the JSON example below,
        the Text tabs  properties `StudentLastName` and `StudentFirstName`
        will be auto-populated as specified ("Doe" and "John")
        each place they appear throughout the envelope.

        ```
        "tabs": {
          "textTabs": [
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentLastName",
            "value": "Doe"
          },
          {
            "tabLabel": "\\*StudentFirstName",
            "value": "John"
          }]
        }
        ```

      * Each occurrence of the tab must have identical properties.

        For example, suppose there are two Text tabs in a document,
        each with `tabLabel` set to `Name`.
        If one tab has the `bold` property set to **true**,
        and the other has the `bold` property set to **false**,
        only the first one will be populated.
        In order to automatically populate both occurrences
        of the `Name` Text tabs,
        the `bold` property must be set to the same value for both tabs.

  - name: Envelopes
    summary: Creating and sending envelopes
    description: |+
      The DocuSign API Envelope category includes the resources and methods for sending and managing envelopes and envelope data.

      Envelopes are the key objects within the DocuSign eSignature system. As a result, they are complex data structures with few required fields. See the [API Recipes](https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/recipes) for use case examples and their solutions.

      To create and send envelopes, see the [Envelopes resource](Envelopes).

  - name: Connect
    summary: Connect configuration and logging
    description: |-
      The Connect category enables your application to be called via HTTPS when an event of interest occurs.

      Use the Connect service to "end the polling madness." With Connect, there is no need for your application to poll DocuSign every 15 minutes to learn the latest about your envelopes.

      Instead, you register your interest in one or more types of envelope or recipient events. Then, when an interesting event occurs, the DocuSign platform will contact your application with the event's details and data. You can register interest in envelopes sent by particular users in your account, or for envelopes sent by any user.

      ## Incoming Connect Calls
      To use the Connect service, your application needs to provide an https url that can be called from the public internet. If your application runs on a server behind your organization's firewall, then you will need to create a "pinhole" in the firewall to allow the incoming Connect calls from DocuSign to reach your application. Other techniques for receiving the incoming calls including proxy servers and DMZ networking can also be used.

      ## Per-envelope Connect Configuration
      Instead of registering a general Connect configuration and listener, an individual envelope can have its own Connect configuration. See the `eventNotification` field for envelopes.

      ## Categories
      Use the Connect category for:

      * Programmatically creating Connect configurations. Connect configurations can be created manually by using the DocuSign web service, or programmatically via the API. Configurations created via the API can be seen and updated from the web service.
      * Retrieving and managing the event log for your Connect configurations.
      * Requesting that an event be re-published to the listener.

      emailRecipientPostSigningURL:
        description: ''
        type: string
      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          *Example*:

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

          *Example*: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as `ID Check $` and `SMS Auth $`. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` should be `ID Check $`. If you wanted to use SMS, it would be `SMS Auth $` and you would need to add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.

      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

      emailRecipientPostSigningURL:
        description: ''
        type: string
      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          *Example*:

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          *Example*: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as `ID Check $` and `SMS Auth $`. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` should be `ID Check $`. If you wanted to use SMS, it would be `SMS Auth $` and you would need to add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.

  formulaTab:
    description: |
      The value of a formula tab is calculated
      from the values of other
      number or date tabs in the document.
      When the recipient completes the underlying fields,
      the formula tab calculates and displays the result.

      The `formula` property of the tab
      contains the references
      to the underlying tabs.
      See [Calculated Fields][calculatedfields]
      in the DocuSign Support Center
      to learn more about formulas.

      If a formula tab contains
      a `paymentDetails` property,
      the tab is considered a payment item.
      See [Requesting Payments Along with Signatures][paymentguide]
      in the DocuSign Support Center
      to learn more about payments.

          Contains the formula
          for calculating the value of
          this tab.

          Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
          enclosed in brackets,
          to refer to it.

          For example,
          you want to present the total cost
          of two items, tax included.

          The cost of each item is stored
          in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
          The tax rate is in a number tab
          labeled TaxRate.

          The formula string for this property
          would be:
          `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

      number or date tabs in the document.
      When the recipient completes the underlying fields,
      the formula tab calculates and displays the result.

      The `formula` property of the tab
      contains the references
      to the underlying tabs.
      See [Calculated Fields][calculatedfields]
      in the DocuSign Support Center
      to learn more about formulas.

      If a formula tab contains
      a `paymentDetails` property,
      the tab is considered a payment item.

      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          *Example*:

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

      emailRecipientPostSigningURL:

        type: string
      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          *Example*:

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

          *Example*: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as `ID Check $` and `SMS Auth $`. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` should be `ID Check $`.

      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          *Example*: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as `ID Check $` and `SMS Auth $`. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` should be `ID Check $`. If you wanted to use SMS, it would be `SMS Auth $` and you would need to add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.

      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          *Example*: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as `ID Check $` and `SMS Auth $`. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` should be `ID Check $`. If you wanted to use SMS, it would be `SMS Auth $` and you would need to add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.

        type: string
      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          *Example*:

          `http://senderHost/[[mergeField1]]/ beginSigningSession? [[mergeField2]]&[[mergeField3]]`

          When enforce signer visibility is enabled, documents with tabs can only be viewed by signers that have a tab on that document. Recipients that have an administrative role (Agent, Editor, or Intermediaries) or informational role (Certified Deliveries or Carbon Copies) can always see all the documents in an envelope, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent. Documents that do not have tabs are always visible to all recipients, unless they are specifically excluded using this setting when an envelope is sent.

          *Example*: Your account has ID Check and SMS Authentication available and in the web console Identify list these appear as `ID Check $` and `SMS Auth $`. To use ID check in an envelope, the `idCheckConfigurationName` should be `ID Check $`. If you wanted to use SMS, it would be `SMS Auth $` and you would need to add phone number information to the `smsAuthentication` node.

      embeddedRecipientStartURL:
        description: |-
          Specifies a sender provided valid URL string for redirecting an embedded recipient. When using this option, the embedded recipient still receives an email from DocuSign, just as a remote recipient would. When the document link in the email is clicked the recipient is redirected, through DocuSign, to the supplied URL to complete their actions. When routing to the URL, the sender's system (the server responding to the URL) must request a recipient token to launch a signing session.

          If set to `SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient is directed to an embedded signing or viewing process directly at DocuSign. The signing or viewing action is initiated by the DocuSign system and the transaction activity and Certificate of Completion records will reflect this. In all other ways the process is identical to an embedded signing or viewing operation that is launched by any partner.

          It is important to remember that in a typical embedded workflow the authentication of an embedded recipient is the responsibility of the sending application, DocuSign expects that senders will follow their own process for establishing the recipient's identity. In this workflow the recipient goes through the sending application before the embedded signing or viewing process in initiated. However, when the sending application sets `EmbeddedRecipientStartURL=SIGN_AT_DOCUSIGN`, the recipient goes directly to the embedded signing or viewing process bypassing the sending application and any authentication steps the sending application would use. In this case, DocuSign recommends that you use one of the normal DocuSign authentication features (Access Code, Phone Authentication, SMS Authentication, etc.) to verify the identity of the recipient.

          If the `clientUserId` property is NOT set, and the `embeddedRecipientStartURL` is set, DocuSign will ignore the redirect URL and launch the standard signing process for the email recipient. Information can be appended to the embedded recipient start URL using merge fields. The available merge fields items are: envelopeId, recipientId, recipientName, recipientEmail, and customFields. The `customFields` property must be set fort the recipient or envelope. The merge fields are enclosed in double brackets.

          this tab.

          Use a tab's `tabLabel`,
          enclosed in brackets,
          to refer to it.

          For example,
          you want to present the total cost
          of two items, tax included.

          The cost of each item is stored
          in number tabs labeled Item1 and Item2.
          The tax rate is in a number tab
          labeled TaxRate.

          The formula string for this property
          would be:
          `([Item1] + [Item2]) * (1 + [TaxRate])`

          See [Calculated Fields][calculatedfields]

      emailSettings:
        description: |
          A complex element that allows  the sender to override some envelope email setting information. This can be used to override the Reply To email address and name associated with the envelope and to override the BCC email addresses to which an envelope is sent.

          When the emailSettings information is used for an envelope, it only applies to that envelope.

          **IMPORTANT**: The emailSettings information is not returned in the GET for envelope status. Use GET /email_settings to return information about the emailSettings.

          EmailSettings consists of:

          * replyEmailAddressOverride - The Reply To email used for the envelope. DocuSign will verify that a correct email format is used, but does not verify that the email is active. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
          * replyEmailNameOverride - The name associated with the Reply To email address. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
          * bccEmailAddresses - An array of up to five email addresses to which the envelope is sent to as a BCC email. Only users with canManageAccount setting set to true can use this option.
          DocuSign verifies that the email format is correct, but does not verify that the email is active. Using this overrides the BCC for Email Archive information setting for this envelope. Maximum Length: 100 characters.
          *Example*: if your account has BCC for Email Archive set up for the email address 'archive@mycompany.com' and you send an envelope using the BCC Email Override to send a BCC email to 'salesarchive@mycompany.com', then a copy of the envelope is only sent to the 'salesarchive@mycompany.com' email address.

             * reminderFrequency - An interger that sets the interval, in days, between reminder emails.

          * expirations - A complex element that specifies the expiration settings for the envelope. It consists of:

             * expireEnabled - When set to **true**, the envelope expires (is no longer available for signing) in the set number of days. If false, the account default setting is used. If the account does not have an expiration setting, the DocuSign default value of 120 days is used.
             * expireAfter - An integer that sets the number of days the envelope is active.
             * expireWarn - An integer that sets the number of days before envelope expiration that an expiration warning email is sent to the recipient. If set to 0 (zero), no warning email is sent.

        Creates new DocuSign accounts.
        You can use this method to create
        a single account
        or up to 100 accounts at a time.

        When creating a single account,
        the body of the request is a
        [`newAccountDefinition`][newAccountDefinition]
        object.

        If the request succeeds.
        it returns a
        201 (Created) code.
        The response returns the new account ID, password and the default user
        information for each newly created account.


        When creating multiple accounts,
        the body of the request is a
        `newAccountRequests`
        object,
        which contains one or more
        [`newAccountDefinition`][newAccountDefinition]
        objects.
        You can create up to 100 new accounts
        at a time this way.

        The body for a multi-account
        creation request
        looks like this in JSON:

        ```
        {
          "newAccountRequests": [
            {
              "accountName": "accountone",
              . . .
            },
            {
              "accountName": "accounttwo",
              . . .
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        A multi-account request
        looks like this in XML:

        ```
        <newAccountsDefinition xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.docusign.com/restapi">
          <newAccountRequests>
            <newAccountDefinition>
              . . .

        in the response contains specific information
        about the failure.

This setting only applies to the following ID checks: <ul> <li>Phone Authentication</li> <li>SMS Authentication</li> <li>Knowledge-Based ID</li> </ul> This setting takes one of the following options: <ul> <li><p><code>initial_access</code>: The authentication check always applies the first time a recipient accesses the documents. Recipients are not asked to authenticate again when they access the documents from the same browser on the same device. If the recipient attempts to access the documents from a different browser or a different device, the recipient must pass authentication again. Once authenticated, that recipient is not challenged again on the new device or browser. The ability for a recipient to skip authentication for documents is limited to documents sent from the same sending account.</p></li> <li><p><code>each_access</code>: Authentication checks apply every time a recipient attempts to access the envelope. However, you can configure the Authentication Expiration setting to allow recipients to skip authentication when they have recently passed authentication by setting a variable timeframe.</p></li> </ul> |

            The response returns information for a single payment, if a payment ID was used in the endpoint, or a list of payments. If the from date or to date queries or payment ID are not used, the response returns payment information for the last 365 days. If the request was for a single payment ID, the `nextUri` and `previousUri` properties are not returned.

            By default the successor plan and credit card information is included in the response. This information can be excluded from the response by adding the appropriate optional query string with the `setting` set to **false**.

            Response

            The response returns the billing plan information, including the currency code, for the plan. The `billingPlan` and `succesorPlans` property values are the same as those shown in the [ML:Get Billing Plan Details] reference. the `billingAddress` and `creditCardInformation` property values are the same as those shown in the [ML:Update Billing Plan] reference.

            ###### Note: When credit card number information is shown, a mask is applied to the response so that only the last 4 digits of the card number are visible.

            Creates a DocuSign Custom Connect definition for your account. DocuSign Connect enables the sending of real-time data updates to external applications. These updates are generated by user transactions as the envelope progresses through actions to completion. The Connect Service provides updated information about the status of these transactions and returns updates that include the actual content of document form fields. Be aware that, these updates might or might not include the document itself. For more information about Connect, see the [ML:DocuSign Connect Service Guide].

The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

            There are two types of envelope custom fields, text, and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. The list custom field lets the sender select the value of the field from a list you provide.

      /envelopes:
        get:
          description: |
            Retrieves a list of envelopes that match your request.
            A large set of optional filters let you filter
            by date,
            by envelope ID,
            or by status codes.

            Your request must include one or more of the following parameters:

            * `from_date`
            * `envelope_ids`
            * `transaction_ids`


            Getting envelope status using `transaction_ids` is useful
            for offline signing situations where it can be used
            determine if an envelope was created or not. It can be used
            for the cases where a network connection was lost, before
            the envelope status could be returned.

            To avoid unnecessary database queries, the DocuSign
            signature platform first checks requests to ensure that the
            filter set supplied does not result in a zero-size response
            before querying the database.

            For example, for a request with a `from_to_status` of
            `delivered` and a current `status` of `created,sent`,
            DocuSign will always return an empty list.
            This is because the request translates to: find the
            envelopes that were delivered between the `from_date` and
            `to_date` dates that have a current status of `created` or
            `sent`. Since an envelope that has been delivered can
            never have a status of `created` or `sent`, a zero-size
            response would be generated.
            In this case, DocuSign does not query the database
            and returns an empty list immediately.


            The following table shows the valid current envelope
            statuses (`status` parameter) for the different status
            qualifiers (`from_to_status` parameter) in the request. If
            the status and status qualifiers in the API request do not
            contain any of the values shown in the Valid Current
            Statuses column, then an empty list is returned.

            Client applications should check that the statuses (`status`
            parameter) they are requesting make sense for a given
            `from_to_status` parameter value.

            | Status Qualifier<br>(`from_to_status`) | Effective Status Qualifier | Valid Current Statuses                                                      |

            ## Extraneous results

            In some cases, a request for a specific envelope status will
            include envelopes with additional statuses. For example, in
            a request with a `from_date` of 2017-01-01, a `to_date` of
            2017-01-07 and the status qualifier (`from_to_status`) set
            to `delivered`, the response set might contain envelopes
            that were created during that time period, but not delivered
            during the time period. As a workaround, check the envelope
            status values in the result set as needed.

            Creates and sends an envelope or creates a draft envelope.
            Envelopes are fundamental resources in the DocuSign platform
            and are used in a variety of ways.

            With this method you can:

            * Create and send an envelope
              with documents, recipients, and tabs.
            * Create and send an envelope from a template.
            * Create and send an envelope from
              a combination of documents and templates.
            * Create a draft envelope.

            There are many ways to use envelopes.
            You can create and send an envelope
            with a single API request,
            or you can use several API requests
            to create, populate, and send envelopes.

            When you use this method
            to create and send an envelope
            in a single request,
            the following parameters are required:

            | Parameter      | Description |
            | :--------      | :---------- |
            | `status`       | Set to `sent` to send the envelope to recipients.<br>Set to `created` (or don't set at all) to save the envelope as a draft. |
            | `emailSubject` | The subject of the email used to send the envelope. |
            | `documents`    | The documents to be signed. |
            | `recipients`   | The email addresses of the envelope recipients. |

            If you are creating an envelope
            to be sent later,
            save it as a draft
            by either setting `status`
            to `created` or leaving it unset.
            For instance, you can create a draft envelope
            with documents only.
            Using additional API requests,
            you can add the recipients
            and send the envelope
            in subsequent API requests.



            ## Feature Availability

            Not all DocuSign features are available to all accounts.
            Use DocuSign Admin to check and enable feature availability.
            You can also check feature availability via the web application.
            For example, if the web application allows you to send an envelope with SMS authentication,
            then you can use the same feature through the API.

            ## Sending Envelopes

            Documents can be included
            with the Envelopes:create method,
            or a template can include documents.
            Documents can be added by using
            a multipart/form request
            or by using the `documentBase64` property of the [`document` object][documentDef].

            ### Adding Documents to Requests

            There are two ways to add documents to your envelopes:

            1. Use the `documents` property of the envelope definition.
            2. Send this request as a multipart/form `POST`
               with documents added through additional request parts.

            Using the `documents` property is the simpler option,
            but the request may be quite large
            due to the base64 encoding.
            This example shows how to add a document
            using this method.

            ```json
            {
              "status": "sent",
              "emailSubject": "Example of one recipient, type signer",
              "documents": [{
                "documentId": "1",
                "name": "contract.pdf",
                "documentBase64": "base64 document bytes...",
              }],
              "recipients": {
                "signers": [{
                  "name": "Lisa Simpson",
                  "email": "lisa@email.com",
                  "recipientId": "1",
                  "routingOrder": "1",
                  "tabs": {
                    "signHereTabs": [{
                      "xPosition": "150",
                      "yPosition": "200",
                      "documentId": "1",
                      "pageNumber": "1"
                    }],
                  }
                }]
              }
            }
            ```

            If you are using a multipart/form `POST` request,
            you do not have to base64 encode your documents.
            You place the envelope definition in one part
            and the document bytes in another:

            ```
            --AAA
            Content-Type: application/json
            Content-Disposition: form-data

            <ENVELOPE DEFINITION GOES HERE>
            --AAA
            Content-Type:application/pdf
            Content-Disposition: file; filename="contract.pdf"; documentid=1

            <DOCUMENT BYTES GO HERE>
            --AAA--
            ```

            ### Using Supplemental Documents

            Supplemental documents are supporting materials
            such as disclosures and other informational documents
            that need to accompany a document sent for signature.
            These supplemental documents are available to the signer
            to view and acknowledge,
            without making the envelope too large or confusing for signers.

            Supplemental documents use the following properties in the
            [`document` object][documentDef].

            | Name                  | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
            | :-------------------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
            | includeInDownload     | Boolean | When set to **true**, the document is included in the combined document download. The default value is **true**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
            | display               | String  | This string sets the display and behavior properties of the document during signing. The possible values are:<br>`<ul><li><p><code>modal</code><br>The document is shown as a supplement action strip and can be viewed, downloaded, or printed in a modal window.

The document is shown in the normal signing window.</li></ul> |
            | signerMustAcknowledge | String  | Sets how the signer interacts with the supplemental document. The possible values are:<br><ul><li><p><code>no_interaction</code><br>No recipient action is required.</p></li><li><p><code>view</code><br>The recipient is required to view the document.</p></li><li><p><code>accept</code><br>The recipient is required to accept the document by selecting accept during signing, but is not required to view the document.</p></li><li><p><code>view_accept</code><br>The recipient is required to view and accept the document.</p></li></ul>                                                                                                                                                    |


            [viewtab]: /esign/restapi/Envelopes/EnvelopeRecipientTabs/#view-tab

            The [View][viewtab] and Approve tabs
            are used to set the interactions
            for individual recipients.
            The View tab includes a `required` property
            that requires the recipient to view the supplemental document.
            If the View tab `required` property is not set,
            the recipient can, but is not required to,
            view the supplemental document.

            To use the View and Approve tabs for
            supplemental documents,
            the document `display` property
            must be set to `modal` or `download`.

            The actions that the recipient must take
            depend on the value
            of the `signerMustAcknowledge` document property
            and
            whether the signer is assigned
            View or Approve tabs
            on the document.

            To set the interactions for individual recipients,
            set the `signerMustAcknowledge` property
            to `no_interaction`,
            then add View and Approve tabs
            on the appropriate document for the recipient.


            The action that a signer must take
            depends on the value of the
            `signerMustAcknowledge` document property,
            whether the signer has an Approve tab,
            and the value of the
            `required` property of the View tab.
            The following table
            shows the actions a recipient must take
            for different combinations
            of these tabs and properties.



            | Document `signerMustAcknowledge`property  | Approve Tab | View Tab `required` property  | Recipient is required to ...  |
            | :----                                     | :----       | :----                         | :----                         |

            ### Recipient Types

            An [`envelopeDefinition` object][envelopeDef] is used as the method's body.
            Envelope recipients can be defined in the envelope or in templates.
            The `envelopeDefinition` object's `recipients` property
            is an [`EnvelopeRecipients` resource object][envelopeRecipientsDef].
            It includes arrays of the seven types of recipients defined by DocuSign:

            | [Carbon Copies][ccDef]              | Carbon copy recipients get a copy of the envelope but don't need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents. This type of recipient can be used in any routing order. Carbon copy recipients receive their copy of the envelope when the envelope reaches the recipient's order in the process flow and when the envelope is completed.                                                                                                                                      |
            | [Certified Deliveries][certfiedDef] | Certified delivery recipients must receive the completed documents for the envelope to be completed. However, they don't need to sign, initial, date or add information to any of the documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
            | [Editors][editorDef]                | Editors have the same management and access rights for the envelope as the sender. They can make changes to the envelope as if they were using the Advanced Correct feature. This recipient can add name and email information, add or change the routing order and set authentication options for the remaining recipients. Additionally, this recipient can edit signature/initial tabs and data fields for the remaining recipients. The recipient must have a DocuSign account to be an editor. |
            | [In-Person Signers][inPersonDef]    | An in-person recipient is a DocuSign user, acting as a Signing Host, who is in the same physical location as the signer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

            Additional information about the different types of recipients
            is available from the [`EnvelopeRecipients` resource page][envelopeRecipientsRes]
            and from the Developer Center [Recipients][devecenterrecipients] topic.



            ### Tabs

            Tabs (also referred to as tags and fields in the web application),
            can be defined in the `envelopeDefinition`,
            in templates, by transforming PDF Form Fields,
            or by using Composite Templates (see below).

            The `inPersonSigner`, and `signer` recipient objects
            include a `tabs` property.
            It is an [`EnvelopeRecipientTabs` resource object][envRecipientTabsDef]
            that includes arrays of the different tab types available.
            See the [`EnvelopeRecipientTabs` resource][envRecipientTabsRes] for more information.


            ## Using Templates

            Envelopes use specific people or groups as recipients.
            Templates can specify a role, eg `account_manager.`
            When a template is used in an envelope,
            the roles must be replaced with specific people or groups.

            When you create an envelope using a `templateId`,
            the different recipient type objects
            within the [`EnvelopeRecipients` property][envelopeRecipientsDef]
            are used to assign recipients to the template's roles via the `roleName` property.
            The recipient objects can also override settings
            that were specified in the template,
            and set values for tab fields that were defined in the template.

            ### Message Lock

            When a template is added or applied to an envelope,
            and the template has a locked email subject and message,
            that subject and message are used for the envelope
            and cannot be changed
            even if another locked template
            is subsequently added or applied to the envelope.
            The `messageLock` property is used to lock the email subject and message.

            If an email subject or message is entered
            before adding or applying a template with `messageLock` set to **true**,
            the email subject and message is overwritten
            with the locked email subject and message from the template.

            ## Envelope Status

            The status of sent envelopes
            can be determined through the DocuSign webhook system
            or by polling.
            Webhooks are highly recommended:
            they provide your application with the quickest updates when an envelope's
            status changes.
            DocuSign limits polling to once every 15 minutes or less
            frequently.
            See [API Rules and Limits](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/resource-limits) in the **Resource Limits Guide** for additional information and examples.


            When a webhook is used,
            DocuSign calls your application via the URL you provide, with a notification XML message.

            See the
            [Webhook recipe](https://www.docusign.com/developer-center/recipes/webhook-status)
            for examples and live demos of using webhooks.

            ## Webhook Options

            The two webhook options,
            `eventNotification` and Connect,
            use the same notification mechanism and message formats.
            Use `eventNotification` to create a webhook
            for a specific envelope sent via the API.
            Connect webhooks can be used
            for any envelope sent from an account,
            from any user, from any client.
            The [Connect guide][connectGuide] discusses the webhook notification message format.

            ### eventNotification Webhooks

            The Envelopes:create method
            includes an optional [`eventNotification` object][eventNotificationDef] property
            that adds a webhook to the envelope.
            `eventNotification` webhooks are available for all DocuSign accounts with API access.

            ### Connect Webhooks

            Connect can be used to create a webhook
            for all envelopes sent by all users in an account,
            either through the API or through other DocuSign clients (web, mobile, etc).
            Connect configurations are independent of specific envelopes.
            A Connect configuration includes a filter
            that may be used to limit the webhook to specific users, envelope statuses, etc.

            You can create and manage Connect configurations with
            the [ConnectConfigurations resource][connectConfigurationsRes].
            Configurations can also be created and managed from DocuSign Admin
            accessed by selecting **Go to Admin** from the menu
            next to your picture on the DocuSign web app.
            See the **Connect** topic in the **Integrations** section of DocuSign Admin.
            For repeatability, and to minimize support questions,
            creating Connect configurations via the API is recommended, especially for ISVs.

            Connect is available for some DocuSign account types.
            Please contact DocuSign Sales for more information.

            ## Composite Templates

            The Composite Templates feature,
            like [compositing in film production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing),
            enables you to overlay
            document,
            recipient,
            and tab definitions
            from multiple sources,
            including PDF Form Field definitions,
            templates defined on the server,
            and more.

            Each Composite Template consists of optional elements: server templates,
            inline templates, PDF Metadata templates, and documents.

            * The Composite Template ID is an optional element used to identify the
              composite template. It is used as a reference when adding document
              object information via a multipart HTTP message. If used, the document
              content-disposition must include the `compositeTemplateId` to which the
              document should be added. If `compositeTemplateId` is not specified in
              the content-disposition, the document is applied based on the
              `documentId` only. If no document object is specified, the composite
              template inherits the first document.

            * Server Templates are server-side templates stored on the DocuSign
              platform. If supplied, they are overlaid into the envelope in the order
              of their Sequence value.

            * Inline Templates provide a container to add documents, recipients,
              tabs, and custom fields. If inline templates are supplied, they are
              overlaid into the envelope in the order of their Sequence value.

            * Document objects are optional structures that provide a container to
              pass in a document or form. If this object is not included, the
              composite template inherits the *first* document it finds from a server
              template or inline template, starting with the lowest sequence value.

            PDF Form objects are only transformed from the document object. DocuSign
            does not derive PDF form properties from server templates or inline
            templates. To instruct DocuSign to transform fields from the PDF form,
            set `transformPdfFields` to **true** for the document.

            See [PDF Form Field Transformation](#pdf-form-field-transformation)
            for more information about process.

            * PDF Metadata Templates provide a container to embed design-time
              template information into a PDF document. DocuSign uses this information
              when processing the Envelope. This convention allows the document to
              carry the signing instructions with it, so that less information needs
              to be provided at run-time through an inline template or synchronized
              with an external structure like a server template. PDF Metadata
              templates are stored in the Metadata layer of a PDF in accordance with
              Acrobat's XMP specification. DocuSign will only find PDF Metadata
              templates inside documents passed in the Document object (see below). If
              supplied, the PDF metadata template will be overlaid into the envelope
              in the order of its Sequence value.

            ### Compositing the Definitions

            Each Composite Template adds a new document and templates overlay into
            the envelope. For each Composite Template these rules are applied:

            * Templates are overlaid in the order of their Sequence value.
            * If Document is not passed into the Composite Template's `document`
              field, the *first* template's document (based on the template's Sequence
              value) is used.
            * Last in wins in all cases except for the document (i.e. envelope
              information, recipient information, secure field information). There is
              no special casing.

            For example, if you want higher security on a tab,
            then that needs to be specified in a later template (by sequence number)
            than where the tab is included.
            If you want higher security on a role recipient,
            then it needs to be in a later template
            than where that role recipient is specified.

            * Recipient matching is based on Recipient Role and Routing Order. If
              there are matches, the recipient information is merged together. A final
              pass is done on all Composite Templates, after all template overlays
              have been applied, to collapse recipients with the same email, username
              and routing order. This prevents having the same recipients at the same
              routing order.

            * If you specify in a template that a recipient is locked, once that
              recipient is overlaid the recipient attributes can no longer be changed.
              The only items that can be changed for the recipient in this case are
              the email, username, access code and IDCheckInformationInput.

            * Tab matching is based on Tab Labels, Tab Types and Documents. If a Tab
              Label matches but the Document is not supplied, the Tab is overlaid for
              all the Documents.

            For example, if you have a simple inline template with only one tab in
            it with a label and a value, the Signature, Initial, Company, Envelope
            ID, User Name tabs will only be matched and collapsed if they fall in
            the exact same X and Y locations.

            * `roleName` and `tabLabel` matching is case sensitive.

            * The `defaultRecipient` property enables you to specify which recipient
              the tabs generated from a PDF form are mapped to. You can also set PDF
              form generated tabs to a recipient other than the default recipient by
              specifying the mapping of the tab label that is created to one of the
              template recipients.

            * You can use `tabLabel` wild carding to map a series of tabs from the PDF
              form. To use this you must end a tab label with "\*" and then the system
              matches tabs that start with the label.

            * If no `defaultRecipient` is specified, tabs must be explicitly mapped
              to recipients in order to be generated from the form. Unmapped form
              objects will not be generated into their DocuSign equivalents. (In the
              case of Signature/Initials, the tabs will be disregarded entirely; in
              the case of pdf text fields, the field data will be flattened on the
              Envelope document, but there will not be a corresponding DocuSign data
              tab.)

            ### Including the Document Content for Composite Templates

            Document content can be supplied inline, using the `documentBase64` or
            can be included in a multipart HTTP message. If a multipart message is
            used and there are multiple Composite Templates, the document
            content-disposition can include the `compositeTemplateId` to which the
            document should be added. Using the `compositeTemplateId` sets which
            documents are associated with particular composite templates. An example
            of this usage is:

            ```
            --5cd3320a-5aac-4453-b3a4-cbb52a4cba5d
            Content-Type: application/pdf
            Content-Disposition: file; filename="eula.pdf"; documentId=1; compositeTemplateId="1"
            Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
            ```

            ### PDF Form Field Transformation

            Only the following PDF Form FieldTypes are transformed to DocuSign
            tabs:

            * CheckBox
            * DateTime
            * ListBox
            * Numeric
            * Password
            * Radio
            * Signature,
            * Text

            Field Properties that are transformed:

            * Read Only
            * Required
            * Max Length
            * Positions
            * Initial Data

            When transforming a PDF Form Digital Signature Field, the following rules apply.
            Any other PDF Form Digital Signature Field will be transformed to a DocuSign Signature tab


            | If the PDF Field Name contains                              | Then the DocuSign tab will be |

            PDF Form Field Names that include `DocuSignIgnoreTransform`

            PDF Form Date fields that include `DocuSignDateSigned` or `eSignDateSigned`
            will be transformed
            to Date Signed fields.

            ## Template Email Subject Merge Fields

            This feature enables you to insert recipient name and email address
            merge fields into the email subject line when creating or sending from a
            template.

            The merge fields, based on the recipient's `roleName`, are added to the
            `emailSubject` when the template is created or when the template is used
            to create an envelope. After a template sender adds the name and email
            information for the recipient and sends the envelope, the recipient
            information is automatically merged into the appropriate fields in the
            email subject line.

            Both the sender and the recipients will see the information in the email
            subject line for any emails associated with the template. This provides
            an easy way for senders to organize their envelope emails without having
            to open an envelope to check the recipient.

            If merging the recipient information into the subject line causes the
            subject line to exceed 100 characters, then any characters over the 100
            character limit are not included in the subject line. For cases where
            the recipient name or email is expected to be long, you should consider
            placing the merge field at the start of the email subject.

            * To add a recipient's name in the subject line add the following text
              in the `emailSubject` when creating the template or when sending an
              envelope from a template:

               `[[<roleName>_UserName]]`

               Example:

               `"emailSubject":"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA"`

            * To add a recipient's email address in the subject line add the
              following text in the emailSubject when creating the template or when
              sending an envelope from a template:

               `[[<roleName>_Email]]`

               Example:

               `"emailSubject":"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA"`

            In both cases `<roleName>` is the recipient's `roleName` in the template.

            For cases where another recipient (such as an Agent, Editor, or
            Intermediary recipient) is entering the name and email information for
            the recipient included in the email subject, then
            `[[<roleName>_UserName]]` or `[[<roleName>_Email]]` is shown in the
            email subject.

            ## Branding an Envelope

            The following rules are used to determine the `brandId` used in an envelope:

            * If a `brandId` is specified in the envelope or template
              and that `brandId` is available to the account,
              that brand is used in the envelope.
            * If more than one template is used in an envelope,
              and more than one `brandId` is specified,
              the first `brandId` specified is used throughout the envelope.
            * In cases where no brand is specified,
              and the sender belongs to a group:
              - If there is only one brand associated with the group,
                then that brand is used in the envelope.
              - Otherwise, the account's default signing brand is used.
            * For envelopes that do not meet any of the previous criteria,
              the account's default signing brand is used for the envelope.


            ## BCC Email Address Feature

            The BCC Email address feature
            is designed to provide a copy
            of all email communications for external archiving purposes.
            DocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature,
            including the BCC Email Override option,
            include additional signer authentication options.

            Do **not** use this feature
            to send a copy of the envelope
            to a recipient who does not need to sign.
            Use a Carbon Copy or Certified Delivery Recipient type instead.

            ## Merge Recipient Roles for Draft Envelopes

            When an envelope with multiple templates is sent,
            the recipients from the templates are merged according to the template roles,
            and empty recipients are removed.
            When creating an envelope with multiple templates,
            but not sending it (keeping it in a created state),
            duplicate recipients are not merged,
            which could leave duplicate recipients in the envelope.

            To prevent this,
            the query parameter `merge_roles_on_draft`
            should be added when posting a draft envelope (`status` is `created`)
            with multiple templates.
            Doing this will merge template roles and remove empty recipients.


            DocuSign recommends that the `merge_roles_on_draft` query
            parameter be used any time you are creating an envelope with
            multiple templates and keeping it in draft (`status` is `created`) status.

                For some documents, one or more signatures must be witnessed by an appointed [notary public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary_public).

                DocuSign supports eNotary services for many jurisdictions. This example demonstrates how to send an envelope to be signed by Susan Signer with her signature witnessed by Nancy Notary. You must know the name and email address of the signer and the notary public for a signature to be notarized.

                Note that the full legal name of the signer must be used. It will be checked against the signer's government-issued proof of identity by the notary public.

                Please see the [DocuSign eNotary resource page](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-enotary-resources) for further information. It lists the jurisdictions participating in the DocuSign eNotary program and additional reference information.

                Note that eNotary services are not included with all account types and are **not** included by default with demo/developer sandbox accounts. To enable eNotary service for your sandbox account, contact your DocuSign technical support person or DocuSign customer service.

                The example includes event notification via the Connect service.

                DocuSign enables document signers use
                [electronic](https://www.docusign.com/products/electronic-signature) or
                [digital](https://www.docusign.com/how-it-works/electronic-signature/digital-signature) signatures.

                DocuSign has tightly integrated standard digital signatures into the DocuSign Signature platform. This enables a single envelope to include:

                * electronic signatures,
                * AES digital signatures using certificates from DocuSign or from your organization,
                * QES digital signatures from government certified Trust Service Providers (TSPs).

                This example enables the signer to create an eIDAS compliant AES signature with embedded signing. InPerson signers can also use SBS digital signatures.

                [More information on creating SBS digital signature requests.](../../../../guide/appendix/standards_based_signatures.html)

                The `clientId` in the example tells DocuSign that the Signing Ceremony will be embedded.
                The example also includes an `eventNotification` object for receiving envelope status updates from DocuSign.

                ## Embedding the signing ceremony
                1. Send the `Envelopes: create` call as shown below in the Request/Response section.
                2. The response will include the `envelopeId`
                3. Use the [EnvelopeViews: createRecipient](../../EnvelopeViews/createRecipient) request to obtain the redirectURL as follows:

                `POST /v2/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient`

                ````
                {
                    "clientUserId": "1000",
                    "email": "Sam@spade.com",
                    "userName": "Sam Spade",
                    "returnUrl": "https://your_app.example.com",
                    "AuthenticationMethod": "Password"
                }
                ````
                The response will include the `url`. Redirect the user's browser to the url to start the signing ceremony.

                ###### Note: You must **immediately** redirect the user to the url you receive from DocuSign. The url is only valid for 5 minutes. Don't request a recipient view url until you are ready to redirect the user's browser.

              This method lets you make changes to an envelope.
              You can use it to:

              * Send a draft envelope
              * Void an in-process envelope
              * Modify a draft envelope
              * Purge documents and envelope metadata from the DocuSign platform


              <div class="highlight highlight-info">
              <p markdown="1">

              Although the request body for this method
              is a complete envelope definition,
              you only need to provide
              properties that
              you're updating.

              </p>
              </div>


              ## Sending a Draft Envelope

              To send a draft envelope, include this in the request body:

              ```json
              {
                "status": "sent"
              }
              ```


              ## Voiding an In-Process Envelope

              To void an in-process envelope, include this in the request body:

              ```json
              {
                "status": "voided",
                "voidedReason": "The reason for voiding the envelope"
              }
              ```

              ## Modifying Envelope Email Information

              To change the email subject and message of a draft envelope,
              include this in the request body:

              ```json
              {
                "emailSubject": "new email subject",
                "emailBlurb": "new email message"
              }
              ```

              ## Purging Documents from DocuSign


              To place only the documents
              in the purge queue,
              leaving any
              corresponding attachments
              and tabs in the DocuSign platform,
              set the `purgeState` property
              to `documents_queued`.


              ```json
              {
                "purgeState": "documents_queued"
              }
              ```

              To place documents,
              attachments,
              and tabs
              in the purge queue,
              set the `purgeState` property
              to `documents_and_metadata_queued`.

              ```json
              {
                "purgeState": "documents_and_metadata_queued"
              }
              ```


              You can purge documents
              only from completed envelopes
              that are not marked as the authoritative copy.
              The user requesting the purge
              must have permission to purge documents
              and
              must be the sender or be acting on behalf of the sender.



              When the purge request is initiated
              the items to be purged
              are placed in the purge queue
              for deletion in 14 days.
              The sender
              and
              all recipients with DocuSign accounts
              associated with the envelope
              get an email notification
              the the documents will be deleted in 14 days.
              The notification contains a link
              to the documents.
              A second email notification
              is sent 7 days later.
              At the end of the 14-day period
              the documents are deleted from the system.
              Recipients without DocuSign accounts
              do not receive email notifications.


              If your account has a Document Retention policy,
              envelope documents
              are automatically placed
              in the purge queue,
              and notification emails are sent
              at the end of the retention period.
              Setting a Document Retention policy is the same as setting a
              schedule for purging documents.

You can use these fields in the envelopes for your account to record information about the envelope, help search for envelopes, and track information. The envelope custom fields are shown in the Envelope Settings section when a user is creating an envelope in the DocuSign member console. The envelope custom fields are not seen by the envelope recipients.

                There are two types of envelope custom fields, text, and list. A text custom field lets the sender enter the value for the field. With a list custom field, the sender selects the value of the field from a pre-made list.

                Deletes one or more documents from an existing envelope that has not yet been completed.

                To delete a document, use only the relevant parts of the [`envelopeDefinition`](#envelopeDefinition).
                For example, this request body specifies that you want to delete the document whose `documentId` is "1".


                ```text
                {
                  "documents": [
                    {
                      "documentId": "1"
                    }
                  ]
                }
                ```

                The envelope status must be one of:

                - `created`
                - `sent`
                - `delivered`

                ### Important: The BCC Email address feature is designed to provide a copy of all email communications for external archiving purposes. DocuSign recommends that envelopes sent using the BCC for Email Archive feature, including the BCC Email Override option, include additional signer authentication options. To send a copy of the envelope to a recipient who does not need to sign, use a Carbon Copies or Certified Deliveries Recipient Type.

                Updates recipients in a draft envelope or corrects recipient information for an in process envelope.

                For draft envelopes, you can edit the following properties: `email`, `userName`, `routingOrder`, `faxNumber`, `deliveryMethod`, `accessCode`, and `requireIdLookup`.

                Once an envelope has been sent, you can only edit: `email`, `userName`, `signerName`, `signingGroupId`, `routingOrder`, `faxNumber`, and `deliveryMethod`. You can also select to resend an envelope by using the `resend_envelope` option.

                If you send information for a recipient that does not already exist in a draft envelope, the recipient is added to the envelope (similar to the POST).

                    Retrieves the initials image for the specified user. The image is returned in the same format as it was uploaded. In the request you can specify if the chrome (the added line and identifier around the initial image) is returned with the image.

                    The userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user id and the user must be a member of the account.

                    The `signatureIdOrName` paramter accepts signature ID or signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that do not properly URL encode. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you might need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint.

                    For example: "Bob Smith" to "Bob%20Smith"

                    Older envelopes might only contain chromed images. If getting the non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.

                    Retrieves the specified user signature image. The image is returned in the same format as uploaded. In the request you can specify if the chrome (the added line and identifier around the initial image) is returned with the image.

                    The userId specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user ID and the user must be a member of the account.

                    The `signatureIdOrName` parameter accepts signature ID or signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that don't properly URL encode. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces and you might need to URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint.

                    For example: "Bob Smith" to "Bob%20Smith"

                    Older envelopes might only have chromed images. If getting the non-chromed image fails, try getting the chromed image.

                  Returns a URL that enables you to embed the recipient view of the DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer, then the view will provide the signing ceremony.

                  ###### Note: Please redirect the client to the URL. iFrames should not be used, especially if the recipient may be using a mobile or tablet.

                  This method is only used with envelopes in the `sent` status.

                  Your application is responsible for authenticating the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the parameters `assertionId`, `authenticationInstant`, `authenticationMethod`, `clientUserId`, and `securityDomain` to record information on how the recipient was authenticated. At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId` are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope's certificate of completion.

                  ## The event status parameter
                  After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user's browser back to your app via the `returnUrl` that you supply. DocuSIgn appends an `event` query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Don't fetch the envelope's status via Envelopes: get or a similar method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.

                  ## The URL is time-limited
                  The URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated. Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.

                  Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email. Immediately redirect the user's browser to the URL after you receive it.

                  If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation's URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.

                  ## Maintaining State
                  After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the `returnUrl` field. Eg, `https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the user is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable value as the state value.

                  Returns a URL that enables you to embed the sender view of the DocuSign UI in your applications.

                  The returned URL can only be redirected to immediately after it is generated. It can only be used once.
                  Therefore, request the URL immediately before you redirect your user to it.

                  For the best user experience, don't use an iFrame. For iOS devices DocuSign recommends using a WebView.

                  Multiple solutions are available for maintaining your
                  client state. See the **Maintaining State** section of the [Embedded Signing introduction.](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/embedded-signing)

                  After the user has completed the sending view, the browser is redirected to the `returnUrl` you supplied.

                  By default, if the envelope already contains one or more documents, DocuSign will initially show the document tagging view when you redirect to the URL.

                  To start with the envelope's recipients and documents view instead, examine the URL in the method's response.
                  Then change the query parameter from `send=1` to `send=0` to start with the recipients/documents view.

            Creates one or more groups for the account.

            Groups can be used to help manage users by associating users with a group. You can associate a group with a Permission Profile, which sets the user permissions for users in that group without having to set the `userSettings` property for each user. You are not required to set Permission Profiles for a group, but it makes it easier to manage user permissions for a large number of users. You can also use groups with template sharing to limit user access to templates.

            ### Template Email Subject Merge Fields

            Call this endpoint to insert a recipient name and email address merge fields into the email subject line when creating or sending from a template.

            The merge fields, based on the recipient's role name, are added to the `emailSubject` property when the template is created or when the template is used to create an envelope. After a template sender adds the name and email information for the recipient and sends the envelope, the recipient information is automatically merged into the appropriate fields in the email subject line.

            Both the sender and the recipients will see the information in the email subject line for any emails associated with the template. This provides an easy way for senders to organize their envelope emails without having to open an envelope to check the recipient.


            ###### If merging the recipient information into the subject line causes the subject line to exceed 100 characters, then any characters over the 100 character limit are not included in the subject line. For cases where the recipient name or email is expected to be long, you should consider placing the merge field at the start of the email subject.

            To add a recipient's name in the subject line add the following text in the `emailSubject` property when creating the template or when sending an envelope from a template:

            `[[<roleName>_UserName]]`

            Example:

            `"emailSubject":"[[Signer 1_UserName]], Please sign this NDA",`

            To add a recipient's email address in the subject line add the following text in the `emailSubject` property when creating the template or when sending an envelope from a template:

            `[[<roleName>_Email]]`

            Example:

            `"emailSubject":"[[Signer 1_Email]], Please sign this NDA",`


            In both cases the <roleName> is the recipient's contents of the `roleName` property in the template.

            For cases where another recipient (such as an Agent, Editor, or Intermediary recipient) is entering the name and email information for the recipient included in the email subject, then `[[<roleName>_UserName]]` or `[[<roleName>_Email]]` is shown in the email subject.

            The body of this request
            is an array
            of [`Users`][usersobject] objects.
            For each new user,
            you must provide at least
            the `userName`
            and
            an `email`.

            The
            [`userSettings` property](#user-settings)
            is a [name/value][nameValue]
            list that specifies the actions users can
            perform.
            In the example below,
            Tal Mason

            The response returns whether the API execution was successful (200 - OK) or  if it failed. The response contains a user structure similar to the request and includes the user changes. If an error occurred during the DELETE operation for any of the users, the response for that user contains an `errorDetails` node with `errorCode` and `message` properties.

                Retrieves a list of custom user settings for a single user.

                Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve custom user information that can be used in your own system.

                ###### Note: Custom user settings are not the same as user account settings.

                ###Getting Grouped Custom User Settings###

                If the custom user settings you want to retrieve are grouped, you must include the following information in the header, after Content-Type, in the request:

                `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

                Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of customer user settings.

                If the extra header information is not included, only the custom user settings that were added without a group are retrieved.

                ###### Note: Custom user settings are not the same as user account settings.

                Custom settings provide a flexible way to store and retrieve custom user information that you can use in your own system.

                **Important**: There is a limit on the size for all the custom user settings for a single user. The limit is 4,000 characters, which includes the XML and JSON structure for the settings.

                ### Grouping Custom User Settings ###

                You can group custom user settings when adding them. Grouping allows you to retrieve settings that are in a specific group, instead of retrieving all the user custom settings.

                To group custom user settings, add the following information in the header, after Content-Type:

                `X-DocuSign-User-Settings-Key:group_name`

                Where the `group_name` is your designated name for the group of customer user settings. Grouping is shown in the Example Request Body below.

                When getting or deleting grouped custom user settings, you must include the extra header information.

                Grouping custom user settings is not required and if the extra header information is not included, the custom user settings are added normally and can be retrieved or deleted without including the additional header.

                The userId parameter specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's user ID and the user must be a member of the account.

                The `signatureId` parameter accepts a signature ID or a signature name. DocuSign recommends you use signature ID (`signatureId`), since some names contain characters that do not properly encode into a URL. If you use the user name, it is likely that the name includes spaces. In that case, URL encode the name before using it in the endpoint.

                For example encode "Bob Smith" as "Bob%20Smith".

                Adds a user signature image and/or user initials image to the specified user.

                The userId property specified in the endpoint must match the authenticated user's userId and the user must be a member of the account.

                The rules and processes associated with this are:

                * If Content-Type is set to application/json, then the default behavior for creating a default signature image, based on the name and a DocuSign font, is used.
                * If Content-Type is set to multipart/form-data, then the request must contain a first part with the user signature information, followed by parts that contain the images.

                For each Image part, the Content-Disposition header has a "filename" value that is used to map to the `signatureName` and/or `signatureInitials` properties in the JSON to the image.

                For example:
                `Content-Disposition: file; filename="Ron Test20121127083900"`

                If no matching image (by filename value) is found, then the image is not set. One, both, or neither of the signature and initials images can be set with this call.

                The Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64 header, set in the header for the part containing the image, can be set to indicate that the images are formatted as base64 instead of as binary.

                If successful, 200-OK is returned, and a JSON structure containing the signature information is provided, note that the signatureId can change with each API POST, PUT, or DELETE since the changes to the signature structure cause the current signature to be closed, and a new signature record to be created.

          Enables or disables API request logging for troubleshooting.

          When enabled (`apiRequestLogging` is set to true), REST API requests and responses for the user are added to a log. A log can have up to 50 requests/responses and the current number of log entries can be determined by getting the settings. Logging is automatically disabled when the log limit of 50 is reached.

          You can call [ML:GetRequestLog] or [ML:GetRequestLogs] to download the log files (individually or as a zip file). Call [ML:DeleteRequestLogs] to clear the log by deleting current entries.

          Private information, such as passwords and integrator key information, which is normally located in the call header is omitted from the request/response log.

          ###### Note: API request logging only captures requests from the authenticated user. Any call that does not authenticate the user and resolve a userId isn't logged. Meaning that login_information, NewAccounts, or other distributor-credential calls are not logged.

        Retrieves account information for the authenticated user. Since the API is sessionless, this method does not actually log you in.
        Instead, the method returns information about the account or accounts that the authenticated user has access to.

        ###### Important: This method must only be used for the [Legacy Header Authentication](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/legacy) flow. Use the [`AccountServer: userInfo` method](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/user-info-endpoints) for the OAuth2 Authentication Code and [Implicit Grant flows](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-implicit).

        Each account has a `baseUrl` property, returned in the response.
        Use this `baseUrl` in all future API calls as the base of the request URL.

        For each account, the `baseUrl` property includes the DocuSign server, the API version, and the `accountId` property.

        It is not uncommon for an authenticated user to have access to more than one account (and more than one `baseUrl`). Depending on your integration's use case, your integration may choose to:

        * Use the account whose `isDefault` field is `true`.
        * List the available accounts and ask the user to choose one.
        * Enable the system administrator to set the account that should be used by your integration.

        If this method returns successfully, then you also know that the user has successfully authenticated with the DocuSign Signature platform.
